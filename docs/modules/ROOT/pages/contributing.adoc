= Contributing your Extension

To list your extension in the Antora Extensions Registry, you should provide metadata files in your repository. This allows the registry to display rich information about your extension, including descriptions and screenshots.

== Required Files

1. `package.json`: Standard npm package file. The registry uses the `name`, `version`, and `description` fields.
2. `antora-registry.md`: A special Markdown file for registry-specific metadata.

== The `antora-registry.md` File

This file allows you to customize how your extension appears in the registry. It should be placed in the root of your repository.

=== Frontmatter Fields

The registry parses the YAML frontmatter for specific fields:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Field | Description

| `name`
| (Optional) Display name if different from `package.json`.

| `description`
| A short, catchy summary for the extension card (limited to ~150 characters).

| `screenshots`
| A list of objects containing `url` and `caption`. These will be displayed in the screenshot carousel.
|===

=== Content

Everything below the frontmatter is used as the detailed description in the extension's "Insights" panel. Standard Markdown is supported.

=== Template

You can use the following template as a starting point. [link:https://github.com/the-dev-center/antora-extensions-registry/blob/main/templates/antora-registry.md[Download Template]]
