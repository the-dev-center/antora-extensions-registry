# Walkthrough - Antora Extensions Registry

I have successfully built the foundation for the Antora Extensions Registry. The project includes a SolidStart application for the registry UI, a Drizzle-managed SQLite database for extension metadata and dependencies, and an Antora documentation site.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. SolidStart Foundation

- Initialized with a premium design system using Tailwind CSS, including dark mode, glassmorphism, and smooth animations.
- Implemented a recursive **Search Tree** that groups extensions under their parent bundles.
- Created a slide-over **Extension Insight** panel for detailed information.

### 2. Dependency Intelligence

- **Indexer Service**: Automatically parses `package.json` to extract metadata and dependencies (excluding Antora native packages).
- **Dependency Analyzer**: Recursively resolves dependency trees to find sub-dependencies.
- **Dependency Cache**: DB schema designed to store resolved dependencies for fast retrieval.

### 3. Comprehensive Authentication

- **Multi-provider Login**: Integrated GitHub, GitLab, Google, Microsoft, and Email magic links.
- **Custom UI**: Created a premium sign-in experience where all methods are presented as high-fidelity buttons.

### 4. Documentation & Infrastructure

- **Antora Docs**: Created in the `docs/` folder, configured with the `antora-dark-theme`.
- **Git Repository**: Initialized, committed, and pushed to [the-dev-center/antora-extensions-registry](https://github.com/the-dev-center/antora-extensions-registry).
- **Local Database**: Initialized with a seed script for immediate testing.

## Pending Actions

Please refer to the [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for remaining manual steps:

1. Configure OAuth secrets for providers.
2. Resolution of a persistent SSR build warning in Vinxi (added to TODO).
3. Point `antora-extensions.org` to the host.
